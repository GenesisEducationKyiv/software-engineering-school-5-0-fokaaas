# ADR-001: Choosing a database to store user subscriptions

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2025-06-07

**Author:** Stanislav Basarab

## Context

We need to store user subscriptions in a database. The database should be able to handle a large number of records, support complex queries, and provide good performance for read and write operations.

## Considered options

### 1. PostgreSQL

**Pros:**
- Stable and widely adopted open-source RDBMS.
- Rich support for SQL features, indexing, and transactions (ACID compliance).
- Well-supported by ORM libraries like Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize.
- Excellent integration with tools for backup, monitoring, and scaling.

**Cons:**
- Slightly more overhead in deployment/configuration compared to SQLite or Firebase.
- Requires a separate running service (not embedded).

### 2. MongoDB

**Pros:**
- Schema-less, flexible data model.
- Easy to start with, popular among JavaScript developers.
- Scales horizontally more naturally for very large datasets.

**Cons:**
- Lacks strong relational features (joins are limited and expensive).
- Risk of data inconsistency if not carefully modeled.

---

### 3. MySQL

**Pros:**
- Mature relational database with good performance and tooling.
- ACID compliant and supports foreign keys, indexing, etc.
- Broad support across hosting platforms and ORMs.
- Slightly lower memory footprint than PostgreSQL in some configurations.

**Cons:**
- Less advanced SQL and JSON functionality compared to PostgreSQL.
- Historically more limited full-text search and window function support.

## Decision

We chose **PostgreSQL** for its strong relational capabilities, ACID compliance, and reliable support for complex queries and data integrity. Its maturity, tooling, and developer familiarity make it a solid foundation for subscription management. The slight overhead in setup is justified by long-term scalability and maintainability.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reliable relational modeling and strong transactional guarantees.
- Ability to enforce data integrity and constraints.
- Scalable for future needs (e.g., analytics, reporting).
- Developer familiarity and strong tooling.

### Negative
- Requires setup of a PostgreSQL service or Docker container and maintenance (backups, upgrades).
- Might be overkill for very simple use cases, though acceptable for this project.
