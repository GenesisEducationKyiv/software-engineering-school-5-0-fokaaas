# ADR-003: Choosing ORM for data access

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2025-06-07

**Author:** Stanislav Basarab

## Context

We are building a backend service that interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage user subscriptions. For this purpose, we need an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) lib that:

- Supports **TypeScript** and **PostgreSQL**.
- Provides **type safety** and autocompletion for queries and models.
- Simplifies common operations like creating, updating, and querying data.
- Can be easily integrated with **NestJS**.
- Has support for **migrations**, **relations**, **transactions**, and **raw queries** if needed.

The ORM should help reduce boilerplate code and improve maintainability, without sacrificing performance or flexibility.

## Considered options

### 1. Prisma

**Pros:**
- Excellent TypeScript support with generated types for models and queries.
- Simple and declarative schema definition language.
- Built-in support for migrations, seeders, and relation handling.
- Works well with PostgreSQL, and has good documentation and active community.
- Clear data access patterns (`prisma.user.findMany()` etc).

**Cons:**
- Can cause memory leaks if PrismaClient is misused.
- Requires regeneration of client after schema changes (`yarn prisma generate`).
- Still maturing in some advanced features (e.g., custom joins, dynamic filters).

### 2. TypeORM

**Pros:**
- Full-featured ORM with support for decorators and entities.
- Deep integration with NestJS ecosystem.
- Allows both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns.

**Cons:**
- Type safety is weaker compared to Prisma.
- More complex to configure and debug.

---

### 3. Sequelize

**Pros:**
- Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more.
- Provides a flexible query-building API.
- Built-in support for transactions, migrations, associations, and hooks.
- Large community and good documentation.

**Cons:**
- Lacks full static type safety â€” requires manual typings for models.
- Heavier API with more boilerplate code in large-scale projects.
- Integration with NestJS is possible but not as seamless as Prisma or TypeORM.

## Decision

We chose **Prisma** as the ORM for accessing our PostgreSQL database.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Type-safe, modern developer experience with strong IDE support.
- Simplifies most CRUD and relation operations.
- Easy to integrate with NestJS via `@prisma/client` and `PrismaModule`.
- Great tooling for migrations and seeding.

### Negative
- Requires separate CLI commands for schema sync and generation.
- Less flexibility than raw SQL or Sequelize in complex dynamic queries.
